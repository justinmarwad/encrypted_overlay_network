# Cryptography Overview

We utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS) in our project to ensure that connections are secure. The TLS handshake works with Perfect Forward Secrecy and provides privacy and data integrity protection and prevents replay attacks. The TLS algorithm is very effective because it is both extremely secure as well as very efficient. It utilizes both asymmetric and symmetric cryptography because it recognizes the former to be highly secure while also understanding that the latter is much faster.
